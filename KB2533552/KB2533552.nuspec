        <summary>This update fixes an issue that may occur during installation of Service Pack 1 for Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.</summary>
        <description>
Consider the following scenario:
You install Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1), Windows 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (SP1), or Windows Embedded Standard 7 SP1 on a computer.
You install some other updates before you restart the computer to complete the installation process. Or, the service pack is installed at the same time as other updates by using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).
In this scenario, the computer may stop responding or restart. If the computer restarts, you receive an error message that resembles the following on a black screen: 0xC0000034

Note: If the computer stops responding and you restart the computer, you receive the same error message.

This issue occurs because Windows tries to perform operations in the Primitive Operation Queue (POQ) two times during the service pack installation process. The second attempt to perform these operations fails (because the operations have already been performed). Therefore, Windows generates a "0xc0000034" error.

This update should be installed to resolve this issue with Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, and Windows Embedded Standard 7 SP1, and to help avoid this issue with future updates.

This update is one of the recommended updates to install before installing Service Pack 1 for Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

On systems other than Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, this package installs successfully, but does nothing.
